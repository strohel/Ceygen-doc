About
=====

Ceygen is a binary Python extension module helper for linear algebra with Cython_
`typed memoryviews`_. Cython is built atop of `Eigen C++ library`_. Ceygen is **not**
a Cython wrapper or an interface to Eigen!

The name Ceygen is a rather poor wordplay on Cython + Eigen; it has nothing to do
with software piracy.

Features
========

Ceygen...

* **is fast** - Ceygen's primary raison d'Ãªtre is to provide overhead-free algebraic
  operations for Cython projects that work with `typed memoryviews`_ (especially
  small-sized). For every function there is a code-path where no Python function is
  called, no memory is allocated on heap and no data is copied.
  `Eigen itself performs rather well`_, too.
* **is documented** - see `Documentation`_
* **supports various data types** - Ceygen uses Cython `fused types`_ (a.k.a. wannabe
  templates) along with Eigen's template nature to support various data types without
  duplicating code. While just a few types are pre-defined (float, double, ...), adding
  a new type is a matter of adding 3 lines and rebuilding Ceygen.
* **is extensively tested** - Ceygen's test suite validates every public Cython method,
  including errors raised on invalid input. Thanks to Travis CI, `every push is
  automatically tested`_ against **Python 2.6**, **2.7**, **3.2** and **3.3**.
* **is multithreading-friendly** - Every Ceygen function doesn't acquire the GIL_
  unless it needs to create a Python object (always avoidable); all functions are
  declared nogil_ so that you can call them in prange_ blocks without losing parallelism.
* **provides descriptive error messages** - Care is taken to propagate all errors
  properly (down from Eigen) so that you are not stuck debugging your program. Ceygen
  functions don't crash on invalid input but rather raise reasonable errors.
* works well with NumPy_, but doesn't depend on it. You don't need NumPy to build or run
  Ceygen, but thanks to Cython, `Cython memoryviews and NumPy arrays`_ are fully
  interchangeable without copying the data (where it is possible). The test suite
  currently makes use of NumPy because of our laziness. :-)

On the other hand, Ceygen...

* **depends on Eigen build-time**. Ceygen expects *Eigen 3* headers to be installed under
  ``/usr/lib/eigen3`` when it is being built. Installing Eigen is a matter of unpacking
  it, because it is a pure template library defined solely in the headers. Ceygen doesn't
  reference Eigen at all at runtime because all code is complited in.
* **still provides a very little subset of Eigen functionality**. We add new functions
  only as we need them in another projects, but we believe that the hard part is the
  infrastructure - implementing a new function should be rather straightforward (with
  decent Cython and C++ knowledge). We're very open to pull requests!
  (do include unit tests in them)
* **needs recent Cython** to compile. [#cythonvers]_ If this is a problem, you can
  distribute .cpp files or final Python extension module instead.
* **doesn't bring Eigen's elegance to Cython** - if you think of lazy evaluation and
  advanced expessions, stop dreaming. Ceygen will make your code faster, not nicer.
  `Array expessions`_ will help here.

Building
========

Ceygen uses standard Distutils to build, test and install itself, simply run:

* ``python setup.py build`` to build Ceygen
* ``python setup.py test`` to test it (inside build directory)
* ``python setup.py install`` to install it
* ``python setup.py clean`` to clean generated object, .cpp and .html files (perhaps to
  force recompilation)

Commands can be combined, automatically call dependent commands and can take options,
the recommended combo to safely install Ceygen is therefore ``python setup.py -v test install``.

Building Options
----------------

You can set various build options as it is usual with distutils, see
``python setup.py --help``. Notable is the `build_ext` command and its `--include-dirs`
(standard) and `--cflags` (Ceygen extension) options:

--include-dirs
   defaults to `/usr/include/eigen3` and must be specified if you've installed Eigen 3
   to a non-standard directory,

--cflags
   defaults to `-O2 -march=native`. Please note that it is important to enable
   optimizations and generation of appropriate MMX/SSE/altivec-enabled code as the actual
   computation code from Eigen is built along with the boilerplate Ceygen code.

The resulting command could look like ``python setup.py build -v build_ext
--include-dirs=/usr/local/include/eigen3 --cflags="-O3 -march=core2" test``. The
same could be achieved by putting the options to a `setup.cfg` file::

   [build_ext]
   include_dirs = /usr/local/include/eigen3
   cflags = -O3 -march=core2

Documentation
=============

Ceygen documentation is maintained in reStructuredText_ format under ``doc/`` directory
and can be exported into a variety of formats using Sphinx_ (version at least 1.0 needed).
Just type ``make`` in that directory to see a list of supported formats and for example
``make html`` to build HTML pages with the documentation.

On-line documentation is in the works.
